# Ansible Playbooks
A collection of my playbooks as I learn Ansible within my virtual environment. This collection is not maintained for production use but is instead catered for my testing and learning/development.

## Goals
- [X] Create Operational Playbooks üëç
- [X] Implement Ansible-Vault for sensitive information üìã
- [X] Publish basic .zip or .tar file to bring a [collection of useful playbooks](https://github.com/NetworkNick-io/Operations/releases) into isolated environments üõÇ
- [ ] Create "one-touch" deployment playbook for Cisco IOS XE and NXOS network devices üë®‚Äçüíª
- [ ] Simplify compliance and change-management with audit playbooks ü¶∫

## Testbed
These playbooks were made for testing certain features or Ansible modules and aren't made for functional purposes.

  ```diff
  - This environment supports dropping authenticated users into enable mode by default. If your environment does not or cannot support this, you will have to append become: yes, become_method: enable, and become_password: enablePW, to your playbook, vault, or var files.

  - Certain playbook features (namely connection:local) is not ideal for production use. Best-practices involve implementing connection: network_cli, but this is not supported in my virtual environment.
