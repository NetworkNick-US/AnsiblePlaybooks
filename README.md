# LearningAnsible
A collection of my plays and playbooks as I learn Ansible within my virtual lab environment. This collection is not maintained for production use but is instead catered for my testing and learning/development.

## Goals
- [X] Create Operational Playbooks üëç
- [ ] Implement Ansible-Vault for sensitive information üìã
- [ ] Create "one-touch" deployment playbook for IOS XE and NXOS network devices üë®‚Äçüíª
- [ ] Publish basic .zip or .tar file to bring a collection of useful playbooks into isolated environments üõÇ
- [ ] Simplify compliance and change-management with audit playbooks ü¶∫
